# Halloween Skeleton Interactive Display

## Project Overview:

The **Halloween Skeleton Interactive Display** is a creative and spooky project designed to bring a skeleton to life through motion detection, sound playback, and visual effects. This Arduino-based project incorporates various components, including a PIR sensor, servo motor, LED eyes, and a Wave Shield for audio playback.

## Features:

- **Motion Detection:** Utilizes a PIR sensor to detect nearby motion.
- **Sound Effects:** Plays random spooky sounds using the Wave Shield upon motion detection.
- **Mouth Movement:** Achieves lifelike mouth movement with a servo motor.
- **LED Eyes:** Enhance the visual appeal with glowing LED eyes.
- **Background Video:** Displays a non-copyrighted video in the background for added ambiance.

## Repository Contents:

- **Arduino Code:** The main Arduino script (`HalloweenSkeleton.ino`) controls the behavior of the Halloween Skeleton, integrating all components.
- **Supporting Files:** Additional files, such as sound files (`11.WAV`, `2.WAV`, `13.WAV`, `1.WAV`), are used for audio playback.

## Setup Instructions:

1. Clone this repository to your local laptop.
2. Open the Arduino IDE and load the `HalloweenSkeleton.ino` file.
3. Connect the Arduino board to the appropriate pins for the PIR sensor, servo motor, and LED eyes.
4. Upload the code to your Arduino board.

## Background Decoration:

Consider enhancing the project by adding background decorations to complement the chosen non-copyrighted video. Feel free to customize the video or explore additional features to make the Halloween Skeleton Interactive Display even more engaging.
